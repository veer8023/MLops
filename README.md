MLOps Learning Repository

Overview

This repository is dedicated to learning and exploring the principles, tools, and best practices of MLOps (Machine Learning Operations). The goal is to gain a deeper understanding of how to deploy, monitor, and maintain machine learning models in production environments efficiently.

Objectives

Understand MLOps Concepts: Learn the key principles of MLOps, including CI/CD pipelines, model monitoring, and versioning.

Experiment with Tools: Explore popular tools and platforms like Docker, Kubernetes, MLflow, Kubeflow, and more.

Build Projects: Implement hands-on projects to apply the concepts learned.

Documentation and Sharing: Document the learning process and share knowledge through this repository.

Learning Roadmap

Phase 1: Foundations of MLOps

Learn about version control systems (Git).

Basics of containerization with Docker.

Setting up CI/CD pipelines.

Phase 2: Experimentation and Reproducibility

Introduction to MLflow for experiment tracking.

Managing datasets and model versioning.

Reproducibility in machine learning workflows.

Phase 3: Deployment

Model serving with Flask/FastAPI.

Deploying models using Docker and Kubernetes.

Introduction to serverless deployment platforms like AWS Lambda and GCP Cloud Functions.

Phase 4: Monitoring and Maintenance

Tools for monitoring models in production.

Handling model drift and retraining pipelines.

Logging and alerting best practices.

Phase 5: Advanced Topics

Kubeflow pipelines for orchestration.

Distributed training and hyperparameter optimization.

Scaling machine learning systems.
